# Our project: Greener

Sam Mowbray, Alan Christian and Tuva Kind.

## Amount of time spent on the project

Since we used a design that we had worked on previously, we did not have to work as much on the conceptual design and idea as we would have otherwise. This reduced the amount of time we had to spend on the project. In total I would say that we have worked around 150-200 hours on the project. 

## Future work/what we have not donce

We are happy with how the app is working as of now, but there is definitely some work we could do to improve the proudct, so that it is releasable. This could probably be accomplished within a month of extra work. In the future we would like to make it possible to add recipes for example. There is also a bug in the HTML for the recipes page where the bottom bar of the page doesnt move and stays put even though we scroll down. In tre recipe page, the user should be able to search or filter the recipes through the buttons with different categories such as ”Vegetables”, ”Gluten-free”, etc. This function is not working fully right now, instead we have visualized how the buttons change in color when click, to clarify for the user that other filters can be applied simultaneously. We believe that the search and filter function also is something that can be fixed when polishing the app. The chosen recipes are to show how it might look like, in the end product the goal is to have recipes that matches the products of a particular season, that also can be customizable.
