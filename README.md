# Our project: Greener

Sam Mowbray, Alan Christian and Tuva Kind.

## Amount of time spent on the project

Since we used a design that we had worked on previously, we did not have to work as much on the conceptual design and idea as we would have otherwise. This reduced the amount of time we had to spend on the project. In total I would say that we have worked around 150-200 hours on the project. 

## Future work/what we have not donce

We are happy with how the app is working as of now, but there is definitely some work we could do to improve the proudct, so that it is releasable. This could probably be accomplished within a month of extra work. In the future we would like to make it possible to add recipes for example. There is also a bug in the HTML for the recipes page where the bottom bar of the page doesnt move and stays put even though we scroll down. 
## How to run the project

1) Download the github repository
2) Install vue to your system (https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html)
3) Follow the guide and download all the node modules by implementing the command "npm install"
4) In your IDE, open the terminal and type "npm run dev", and open the local host in chrome or other browser.
